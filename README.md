# Sitemap and Robots.txt Checker

This is a Python script that checks the `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` files of a website. It lists the URLs from the sitemap and extracts the disallowed URLs mentioned in the `robots.txt` file. Additionally, it attempts to access the disallowed URLs and displays whether the access was successful or not.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `BeautifulSoup` library
- `colorama` library

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python from the official Python website: python.org.

2. Install the required libraries by running the following command in your command prompt or terminal:
   ```
   pip install requests bs4 colorama
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the `sitemap_checker.py` file in a text editor.

2. Modify the `sitemap_url` and `robots_url` variables to the appropriate URLs you want to check.

3. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

4. Run the script by executing the following command:
   ```
   python sitemap_checker.py
   ```

5. The script will display the sitemap URLs, the disallowed URLs from the `robots.txt` file, and the status of accessing the disallowed URLs (success or failure).
